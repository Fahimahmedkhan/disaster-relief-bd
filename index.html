                <h2>Flood-affected Sunamganj</h2>
                <p>The emergency response team of ADRA in Bangladesh is on the ground. They’re preparing relief materials for the
                flood-affected community of Sunamganj, Sylhet. Millions of people in Sylhet and Sunamganj have become homeless due to
                the worst flood. More than 4.3 million people are impacted by the unpredicted flash flood and water clogging. Since the
                affected community is returning to their houses, they need food, and daily commodities the most.</p>

                <h2>Cyclone Aila</h2>
                <p>Aila formed over a disturbance over the Bay of Bengal on May 23, 2009 and started to intensify and organize reaching
                sustained wind speeds of 110 kmh (70 mph). It was the worst natural disaster to affect Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in
                November 2007.The storm was responsible for at least 339 deaths across Bangladesh and India; more than 1 million people were left
                homeless. Health officials in Bangladesh confirmed a deadly outbreak of diarrhea on 29 May, with more than 7,000 people
                being infected and four dying. In Bangladesh, an estimated 20 million people were at risk of post-disaster diseases due
                to Aila.</p>

                <p>The fourth named storm of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Sidr formed in the central Bay of Bengal, and
                quickly strengthened to reach peak 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), making it a Category-5 equivalent
                tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Save the Children estimated the number of deaths associated with the cyclone to be between 3,100 and 10,000, while the
                Red Crescent Society reported on November 18 that the number of deaths could be up to 15,000.</p>
